  para1:
    "Srila Prabhupada was a true visionary. He always had very big ideas for the spreading of Krishna consciousness and the ideal Vedic culture. One of Srila Prabhupada’s many gifts to his followers, and the entire world, was his detailed vision for the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium. Srila Prabhupada had a clear vision for the temple, and he expressed it on many occasions. He wanted a unique Vedic Planetarium to present the Vedic perspective of life, including a gigantic display of the material and spiritual worlds, which could be viewed by pilgrims on different levels as they traveled through the Planetarium. Now here in India we are constructing a very large Vedic Planetarium…within the planetarium we will construct a huge, detailed model of the universe as described in the text of the fifth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Within the planetarium the model will be studied by onlookers from different levels by use of escalators. Detailed information will be given on open verandahs at the different levels by means of dioramas, charts, films etc. As in everything he did, Srila Prabhupada was acting in fulfillment of the desires of the previous Acharyas, or spiritual preceptors. A grand temple for Mayapur was predicted by none other than Lord Nityananda, the most intimate associate of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, some five hundred years ago.",
  para2:
    "Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, the father of the modern day Krishna Consciousness movement, narrates a description of the future development of Mayapur given by Sri Nityananda Prabhu to Srila Jiva Goswami: When our Lord Caitanya disappears, by His desire, the Ganges will swell. The Ganges water will almost cover Mayapur for a hundred years, and then the water will again recede. For some time only the place will remain, devoid of houses. Then again, by the Lord’s desire, this place will again be manifest, and the devotees will build temples of the Lord. One exceedingly wonderful temple (adbhuta-mandira) will appear from which Gauranga’s eternal service will be preached everywhere. In July of 1976 Srila Prabhupada expressed his preference for the outer design of the temple. While visiting Washington, he instructed Yadubara Prabhu and Vishakha Mataji to take photos of the Capitol building. When they inquired why, he replied: 'I wanted both of you to take various detailed photographs of that Capitol'. 'The Capitol Building.” Yadubara nodded. “For what purpose, Srila Prabhupada? We shall have a planetarium in Mayapur,' Prabhupada told him. 'To show spiritual world, material world, and so on succession of the planetary systems, everything. A building like that. We are acquiring three hundred and fifty acres of land for constructing a small township to attract people from all the world to see the planetarium. … You take all details, inside, outside. That will be nice'.",
  para3:
    "Later the same month he met George Harrison in London and happily informed him: 'We are just attempting a big planetarium in Mayapur. We have asked government to acquire land, three hundred and fifty acres. That is negotiation going on. We shall give a Vedic planetarium…the construction will be like your Washington capital, like that.' 'A big dome?' George asked. 'Yes.'",
  para4:
    "It was also during this last visit to America that Prabhupada asked Ambarish Prabhu to provide the funds for the new Mayapur temple: 'Now you all together make this Vedic Planetarium very nice, so that people will come and see. From the description of the Srimad-Bhagavatam you prepare this Vedic Planetarium.” He turned to Ambarisha prabhu. “How do you like this idea, Vedic Planetarium?' 'It seems like a very nice idea.' Prabhupada laughed. 'You also like? So finance this project, Vedic Planetarium.' 'Where will this be?' Ambarisha asked him. 'Mayapur. My idea is to attract people of the whole world to Mayapur.'",
  para5:
    "Srila Prabhupada said that the secret of success in spiritual life is to manifest the desires of the previous Acharyas. Therefore our mission is to please Srila Prabhupada and the previous Acharyas by manifesting this temple in a way that most closely follows the instructions and vision of Srila Prabhupada. We invite you to join us on this journey of fulfilling the vision of that great visionary, Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium.",

  chairManVPara1:
    "Welcome to the Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir – Temple of the Vedic Planetarium.",
  chairManVPara2:
    "Whether you are already familiar with the project, or are a new visitor, we hope that this site will be informative as well as inspiring.",
  chairManVPara3:
    "Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir – Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, is the World Headquarters of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The project is located in Sri Mayapur, West Bengal, India, the birthplace of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.",
  chairManVPara4:
    "Srila Prabhupada, who came to Mayapur with nothing, founded the project in the early 1970’s. Srila Prabhupada initially lived in a simple bhajan kutir for some time, and then the Lotus Building was built, becoming the first building constructed in ISKCON. Since that time, through the vision of Srila Prabhupada and the hard work of countless devotees, the project has grown to encompass many areas of devotional service, including the beautiful forms of Sri Sri Radha-Madhava and their (eight) asta-sakhis, Sri Sri Pancha-Tattva, and Sri Sri Prahlada-Nrsimhadeva. Please visit www.mayapur.com for more information.",
  chairManVPara5:
    "Srila Prabhupada’s most cherished dream for Sridham Mayapur was his bold vision for the Sri Mayapur Chandrodaya Mandir – Temple of the Vedic Planetarium. He envisioned a beautiful temple which would bring people from all over the world to the birthplace of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He also wanted the temple to be a Vedic Planetarium, which would present the universe according to the Srimad Bhagavatam, the essence of all Vedic literature and Vedantic philosophy. The Vedic Planetarium would directly challenge the accepted modern version of the universe, and establish the legitimacy of the Vedic version, as well as use science to counteract the prevalence of modern atheism. Srila Prabhupada proposed to exhibit the universe in an exposition which would take the viewer on a journey through the material cosmos to the spiritual world; all according to the descriptions found in Srimad Bhagavatam. Srila Prabhupada wanted these exhibits as well as a beautiful temple housed in a specially built domed building. The temple would also house the Institute of Vedic Cosmology which would continue research into, and discussion of the Vedic account of the universe.",
  chairManVPara6:
    "Over the last nine years, the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium team has created a vision for the project according to the parameters laid out many years ago by Srila Prabhupada. There have been many devotees involved with this effort, most of whom have dedicated countless hours of service as a labor of love for Srila Prabhupada. We have been inspired by the commitment of these devotees, many of whom are young second generation followers of His Divine Grace.",
  chairManVPara7:
    "We hope that the vision created here will inspire all who visit to become involved with the project as it fully unfolds over the coming few years of construction left leading to the Grand Opening in 2022. This short window of time left till the Grand Opening, which will also celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the entire Mayapur project, has appropriately been named the MISSION 22 MARATHON. We still require a good deal of funds to complete the construction having now entered Phase 2 encompassing the exterior and interior finishing work. We have hired a world class Project Management Company (PMC) to help us with that. There are many seva opportunities to donate to the TOVP on this website and we humbly submit our request for your help. Our motto is, “Raising Lord Caitanya’s temple by the hands of every devotee”.",
  chairManVPara8:
    "Please visit often, as we will try to keep the content fresh and sup to date. All of us at the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium team are humbly praying for the blessings of Srila Prabhupada, the previous Acharyas, and all the Vaisnavas. This is a project that has been carried forward for many years by many dedicated devotees. We are hoping that by the mercy of Sri Guru and Sri Gauranga, this monumental effort will soon bear fruit.",

    "At the very inception of the TOVP project, before concluding any contracts and before starting actual construction, the figure of $60 million (US dollars) was mentioned as the projected figure for both the super structure and finishing works. Out of the said $60 million (US dollars) projected calculation, Ambarisa Prabhu gave $25 million (US dollars) with the balance to be collected from the worldwide fundraising campaign. Had we amassed the balance $35 million (US dollars) within a short period of time, we could have possibly finished the TOVP project for $60 to 70 million (US dollars). In spite of the best efforts of our fundraising team, we could not accrue a significant portion of that required balance. Therefore, given the escalating costs of construction materials and services, naturally the initial projected budget was augmented. It is a universally accepted principle that if one does not have all the necessary funds to complete a construction project within a very rapid period of time, the budget naturally increases. Even a 5-star hotel’s construction cost could be $180 to $200 per sq. ft. The TOVP’s current projected budget of 90 million US dollars comes to $150 per sq. ft. This has been accepted by the GBC body and is no cause for concern, considering the usual anticipated escalation in construction costs over time.",
  d2:
    "The central Kalash of the TOVP will be about six stories tall, which is perhaps larger than most other ISKCON temples in the world. All three of the main Kalashas, along with their Chakras, and the smaller Kalashas on the towers, will be stainless steel coated with titanium nitrate. Considering that these three Kalashas will be nothing less than the crown jewel of the entire project, visible from a substantial distance, they must possess and radiate a great aesthetic quality. We are currently in discussion with a company from Russia, where traditionally they have an appreciable expertise in building magnificent Russian Orthodox Churches. The quotations we are receiving from Russia are significantly lower than those from India. The estimated cost for all the Kalashas and Chakras is 1.3 to 1.5 million US dollars.",
  d3:
    "Firstly, we must all understand that the TOVP is not an ordinary building but a unique monument which is meant to endure for at least half a millennium. It suffices to say that such an ‘Adbhut Mandir’ cannot be built like an ordinary residential building. We have spent a significant period of time researching and investigating the best possible construction materials which will sustain for such a long period of time and require a minimum degree of maintenance. At the same time, we have spared no efforts to make a comparative analysis of costs for each and every material to provide a pragmatic and achievable projection of material costs. In such a monumental building, it would be simply unacceptable to have its finishing works completed in a cheap or commercial fashion—the visiting pilgrims from all over the world and the future generations of Vaishnavas would not forgive us if we should do so. However, we can guarantee and ensure you that each and every construction material purchased for the TOVP has been painstakingly considered as to its utility, durability, aesthetic quality and cost benefit.",

Such persons & entities are listed below- TOVP In-House Architectural team - In actuality Srila Prabhupada is the primary architect for the TOVP.

The TOVP team, along with its in-house architectural unit, has intricately researched these instructions of Srila Prabhupada and translated them into the architectural language, designs, and engineering concepts which are being manifested before your eyes today. This architectural set-up has proven more professional, competent and economically viable than any of the other leading architectural firms in the market today. Structural Engineer - Mr. B.B. Choudhary, Planning and Design Bureau. He also headed up the construction of the famous Akshardham project in New Delhi. Gammon India Ltd – Main contractor for TOVP structure and other works.

Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, saints and incarnations, the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium is a unique and ambitious project to make the vast culture and philosophy of the timeless Vedic tradition accessible to everyone. Rising from the plains of the holy land of Sri Mayapur, on the banks of the sacred Ganges River, the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium will be a shining beacon to all aspiring spiritualists who are searching for answers to the questions of life.",
  h2Para2:
    "The temple is being designed according to the sacred architecture that has facilitated spiritual self-realisation for millions of people throughout the ages. Simply seeing the outside of the temple will evoke an appreciation, and awaken the dormant devotion for God in every sincere seeker. Moving inside the temple, the visitor will be astonished by the many informative displays of Vedic Art, Science and Culture. The centerpiece of the complex is the Vedic Planetarium which provides visitors with an enlivening tour of the various regions of the cosmic creation. Beginning from the lower planets, pilgrims travel up through the earthly realm and then on to the higher planetary systems before passing beyond the boundary of the material universe. Within the spiritual realm, visitors view the various spiritual planets, before finally arriving at the topmost spiritual abode of the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. The Vedic Planetarium features a giant rotating model that demonstrates the movements of the planetary systems as described in sacred texts such as the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Explanations and displays are also presented that describe how these movements correspond to the visible universe of our experience.

    "In March 1972, we had the first ISKCON Gaura-Purnima festival in Sridham Mayapur. During that festival, small Radha-Madhava came from Calcutta and were presiding over the program. At that time, only the bhajan-kutir was on the land, so we had a big pandal program.",
  h1Para2:
    "It was in that pandal, either on Gaura-Purnima, or one of the days near it, that Srila Prabhupada performed the foundation ceremony for the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium. A hole was dug about 15 or 20 feet deep, and Srila Prabhupada personally performed the foundation ceremony and installed the deity of Ananta Sesa. There is a picture of Srila Prabhupada down the hole, and also pictures of the fire sacrifice that was performed. Bhavananda Prabhu was there and Acyutananda Prabhu was there. Srila Prabhupada invited all of his godbrother's and many of them came and they helped with the program. At the end of the ceremony the hole was filled up, and Ananta Sesa is still there in that place.",
  h1Para3:
    "The location of the ceremony was east of the bhajan-kutir on the southern side of our land. It was about fifty meters from the bhajan-kutir. At that time, we had only nine bigas of land, three acres, which was the original plot that Tamal Krishna Maharaja had purchased for Srila Prabhupada. The lotus building was built on one end, and Bhaktisiddhanta road was the other end. Where the long building is now was the northern boundary.",
  h1Para4:
    "Later in 1977, the last time Srila Prabhupada was here in Mayapur, it was presented to him that now we have more land on the eastern side, and it would be a much better location for the temple; not so close to the road and more space. Srila Prabhupada sanctioned that, but he never personally went",
  h1Para5:
    "out to the foundation laying ceremony. That was done on the edge of the little forest that is out near the Gurukula. Srila Prabhupada's disciples laid that foundation and Anantadeva. But that very night, someone actually came and dug up the hole and stole Ananta Sesa. It was a very isolated place at that time.",
  h1Para6:
    "Right now, we just had the ground breaking ceremony with Ambarisa Prabhu and Bhavananda Prabhu. Srila Prabhupada told Ambarisa to fund this temple, there's footage of that, some film, and he has stuck it out all these years and is here right now and is coming up with the money. And I would say that Bhavananda Prabhu probably had more instruction about this Temple of the Vedic Planetarium than anyone else. Because he was always here, he was the co-director of Mayapur and he stayed here for many years while Srila Prabhupada was here. So Prabhupada would often tell him what he wanted. He wanted the temple with a big dome and the chandelier inside, the universe should be moving. There should be escalator, moving staircase. He gave the height and everything like that. He instructed Bhavananda that he wanted big Radha-Madhava and asta-sakhi, and Panca-tattva should be there, seven feet tall. And also Srila Prabhupada wanted a parampara altar. So he was telling so many things to Bhavananda about the temple. And Bhavananda is here after so many years. It seems like the original people that Srila Prabhupada entrusted with this work, somehow or another they have come together and it is starting to happen after all these years.",
  h1Para7:
    "There was a letter from Srila Prabhupada to a Dinesh Babu wherein he describes our Mayapur project. He said we will get help from the government, we need this much land, and we will spend this much money. Then he said, The plans and contemplations are going on in different phases, now",
  h1Para8:
    "when Caitanya Mahaprabhu will be pleased it will be taken up. Srila Prabhupada A Letter to Dinesh Babu So even we had the money, still the sanction of the Supreme Lord is needed. Without His sanction nothing can happen. So it looks like the will of Lord Caitanya is there now. The land is cleared, the model is accepted, test piling has begun. Everyone is in agreement, at least all of the authorities. It is happening now, the desire of Lord Caitanya is there.",
  h1Para9:
    "This is a very auspicious time, and historically important also. Finally, after all of these years, this temple is being built. There are predictions given in the Sri Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya. Lord Nityananda Prabhu told Srila Jiva Goswami that after Mahaprabhu leaves, the Ganga will come and flood the whole area for a hundred years. Then for the next three hundred years, the Ganga will move around and all the pastime places get washed away. Then He said, after that, again the task of revealing the dhama will begin again in earnest. So that corresponds to exactly the time when Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura was here and he rediscovered the birthplace of Lord Caitanya. Then Nityananda Prabhu says many bathing ghatas will be built on the Ganga, which we are seeing happening now. Just a few days ago, I think it was the day of the ground breaking ceremony, we received confirmation from the Ministry of Tourism that they will spend several crores of rupees to build a nice ghata where Prabhupada's ghata is. This is to promote tourism; bringing people by speed boat from Calcutta and other places. They were going to build it at some other location, but when they saw that everyone is coming to ISKCON anyway, they said if you give us the land we will do it for you. So this also seems right on time, and everything appears to be very auspicious. This is the prediction of Nityananda Prabhu, so it is happening.",

    "...I would say that Bhavananda Prabhu probably had more instruction about this Temple of the Vedic Planetarium than anyone else. Because he was always here, he was the co-director of Mayapur and he stayed here for many years while Srila Prabhupada was here. H.G. Jananivas Prabhu",
  h1Para11:
    "And Lord Nityananda also says that many residential buildings will spring up in Mayapur. This we are seeing also. As soon as you come to Mayapur you can see. Hundreds of houses are coming up, and they are all devotees. Nityananda Prabhu said they will all have deities in their houses. You go to any of these houses, you will see they all have Jagannatha, Mahaprabhu, Nityananda, or Radha-Krishna. And you will always hear the kértana coming from their houses. So that is another prediction that is happening now.",
  h1Para12:
    "Then Lord Nityananda speaks of this adbhuta-mandira. Prabhupada never mentioned this word adbhuta. But actually he said it in English. Adbhuta means astonishing or wonderful, and Prabhupada did say wonderful. You European and American boys are used to doing something",
  h1Para13:
    "wonderful so go to Mayapur and build some skyscraper. This was his explanation of the adbhuta-mandira. It is a very, very wonderful project.",
  h1Para14:
    "And Nityananda Prabhu said, gauranga nitya-seva haibe vikasa, that from this temple, service to Lord Gauranga will spread all over the world. How do you serve Gauranga Mahaprabhu? By chanting Hare Krishna. This is the main service. He has come to give this, the holy name. So from this temple, the chanting of Hare Krishna goes to every town and village of the world. Prabhupada described it as a flood of love of God. He said in a Sri Caitanya-caritamrita purport, 'In Sridham Mayapur there is sometimes a great flood after the rainy season. This is an indication that from the birthplace of Lord Caitanya the inundation of love of Godhead should be spread all over the world, for this will help everyone, including old men, young men, women and children.' It will happen from this temple. So we have to build this temple, at least we can do that much. Then it is up to the Lord when the holy name spreads to every town and village. Of course, that is the ambition of every devotee in ISKCON, or at least it used to be. We are just longing for that day. This is our ambition, our dream.",
  h1Para15:
    "Srila Prabhupada said that actually this temple already exists, Bhaktivinoda Thakura saw it. He said the Lord desires something, and by His iccha-sakti it automatically becomes manifested. But it exists spiritually. Bhaktivinoda Thakura could see. But we have to go and put the bricks and cement and everything. We have to build it up. Prabhupada said that just like Krishna showed Arjuna on the battlefield that He had already killed everyone, but Arjuna had to go out and fire his arrows and be the instrument. In that way he would get the credit. So Arjuna did that, and became the hero of the battle of Kuruksetra. So Prabhupada said in the same way, you have to go out and build this temple. If you don't do it, somebody else will go out and build it later on, and they'll get the credit. But better that you build it and get the credit. Prabhupada gave this instruction to establish this temple, and we can expect it to happen. It is all happening according to the predictions given.",
  h1Para16:
    "Most probably, this is one of the greatest preaching projects of our time. Following in the footsteps of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, who established the first temple in Sri Dham Mayapur, we expect everyone to 'contribute their mite' for the successful construction of Mahaprabhu's temple.

  h3Para2:
    "As I write, the resplendent Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, its central dome now towering 350 feet above the alluvial soil of Śrīdhāma Māyāpur, continues to reveal its form, within and without. This temple, when complete, will realize a key component of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, vital to the fulfillment of the mission of its Founder-Ācārya: to construct Lord Caitanya’s saṅkīrtana movement as the efficacious vessel for delivering humanity worldwide from the rising floods of the spiritual, mental, and physical calamities of our times.",
  h3Para3:
    "By this undertaking, Śrīla Prabhupāda continued his revival of the interrupted mission of his Guru Mahārāja, and he has left us with all directions and facilities to complete it. Through us, Śrīla Prabhupāda continues his work. The temple taking shape at Māyāpur is central to that task.",
  h3Para4:
    "We know that the intention to establish the spiritual center for the entire movement at Māyāpur inspired Śrīla Prabhupāda when, in 1972, he celebrated Gaura-pūrṇimā by ceremoniously inaugurating this temple—descending below ground to ritually install its cornerstone. On the previous day he had written to his London disciple Caturbhuja dāsa:",
  h3Para5:
    "Now I am pleased that you are making serious study of our Krsna philosophy, so I want that you go on like this until you will able to defeat any challenge from atheists and rascals. Then your preaching work will have real potency and combinedly with your God-brothers around the world and at the London temple you shall preach so strongly that one day this Krsna consciousness movement will change the world from the most dangerous condition. That is the wish of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and tomorrow we shall be celebrating the Lord’s Appearance Day by laying down the corner-stone for our World Headquarters here at Mayapur.",
  h3Para6:
    "Having committed ourselves to what Śrīla Prabhupāda committed himself to in 1972, we now strive to complete the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, the ultimate home of the present Śrī Māyāpur Candrodaya Mandīra. When the golden cakra— signifying the all-pervading power of the Lord—will be ceremoniously established and placed upon the gleaming kalaśa at the pinnacle of the temple, the whole edifice itself will be revealed as the very cakra, the hub and apex, of world-wide ISKCON, that victorious, world-spanning deliverer of the mercy of the Rising Moon of Māyāpur. All other far-flung temples and centers and gathering places of the entire International Society for Krishna Consciousness will be knit together as this central temple’s aṁśas and kalās—its incorporated expansions and sub-expansions—as parts, branches, and limbs of itself.",
  h3Para7:
    "In order to complete this temple, ISKCON itself will have to act as a unified whole, exemplifying that unity in diversity which lies at the heart of Lord Caitanya’s teaching. We may take this as the test of the Founder-Ācārya: “Your love for me,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said in his final months,",

Those who are qualified can directly perceive, for example, that the Lord and His divine names or images are the same. The temple is similarly potent and filled with spiritual power: Śrī Māyāpur Candrodaya Mandīra is the manifest form and emblem of the spiritual dynamo driving the universal saṅkīrtana movement of Lord Caitanya.",

From all over the world they will come.”",
  h3Para16:
    "Two years later in Māyāpur, Śrīla Prabhupāda disclosed the text that had inspired his name for the temple—a phrase found in the first verse of Lord Caitanya’s Śikṣāṣṭaka: śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇam. Mahāprabhu’s beautiful metaphor here likens saṅkīrtana to the rays of the moon (candrikā) that open the perfumed blossoms of the night-blooming lily (kairava) of our topmost good (śreyas)—that is, our eternal relationship with Lord Kŗșṇa.",
  h3Para17:
    "“The ultimate benefit of life is compared with the moon,” Śrīla Prabhupāda said in a Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam class. “So spreading Kŗșṇa consciousness means spreading the moonlight. Therefore we have named this temple Śrī Māyāpur-candrodaya.” The rising (udaya) moon (candra) of Śrī Māyāpur: the name given by Śrīla Prabhupāda intimates that the influence of this temple will come to pervade the entire world.",
  h3Para18:
    "Moreover, “Caitanya-candra” and “Māyāpur-candra” are both names of Lord Caitanya. So “Śrī Māyāpur-candrodaya” denotes the temple as well as Lord Śrī Caitanya Himself, who presides in His five features as the Pañca-tattva on the temple’s central altar. With these and many other elements and components, the great temple becomes the spiritually energetic and energizing center or dynamo from which the blessings of Lord Caitanya become dispersed throughout the world.",

In 1918 Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura had inaugurated His preaching organization—“Gauḍīya Maṭha” or “Gauḍīya Mission”—with the establishment of the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha in Māyāpur. Over the following decade and a half that mission grew to include over sixty Maṭhas, temples with ashrams for sannyāsīs and brahmacārīs.",

    "This impressive achievement, however, was only the foundation of his far more audacious project of establishing Lord Caitanya’s movement in the West. Another vital component: in 1927 Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura endowed English-language preaching with eminent status",

Then three years later, he celebrated the opening of a singularly opulent and imposing temple at Bāg-bazar in Calcutta, designed to serve as his mission’s headquarters for worldwide preaching.",
  h3Para26:
    "Calcutta was a “world city.” It had served as the imperial seat of the British Raj in the East until 1911. The seat was then transfered to Delhi, yet Calcutta continued on as a vibrant center of commerce, finance, and culture. The city was thus an appropriate location for the headquarters of a global mission, and in 1933 Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura saw off three selected disciples as they embarked for London to preach and establish a temple there.",
  h3Para27:
    "Yet from the beginning of Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s hugely ambitious mission, the unique position of the secluded Māyāpur center had been always recognized and honored. In the movement’s published lists of centers, the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha came first and usually bore the distinctive",
  h3Para28:
    "designation of “Parent Math.” But then, in 1930, the dazzling new Calcutta temple—named as “Sri Gaudiya Matha”—with its prominent location, its facade of pure white marble, its lavish appointments, and its bold mission—seemed to eclipse all other centers, especially the sacrosanct “Parent Temple.” There were seeds, as we now know, of an unhealthy rivalry, a fissure opening in the framework of the movement. The Editor of The Harmonist wanted to counteract that tendency. The temple’s grand opening, accordingly, also occasioned the publication of a rich and detailed explication of the relationship between the conspicuous new center in a great city and its “Parent Temple” hidden somewhere out in the remote Bengali countryside.",
  h3Para29:
    "This long essay turned out to be a profound exposition of the spiritual morphology of the entire institution. Titled “Sri Gaudiya Math,” the article was serialized over three issues of The Harmonist, the movement’s English-language periodical, and was produced under the direct personal supervision of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. This three-part essay impressively conveys the theological model of the spiritual institution—the ecclesiology—that guided Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura and, later, as it would turn out, his most resolute and faithful student Śrīla Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda as well.",
  h3Para30:
    "The immediate concern of the article is to elucidate the deep spiritual reasons why the spectacular, newly inaugurated Bāg-bazar temple—“in the modern urban environment,” as the article puts it—is not only subordinate to the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha in Māyāpur, but also is itself an “expansion” of it:",
  h3Para31:
    "The Gaudiya Math (in Calcutta) is the principle branch of Sri Chaitanya Math of Sridham Mayapur. The distinction between the Gaudiya Math and Sri Chaitanya Math is all analogous to that between one lamp lighted by another. The Gaudiya Math is the expansion of the Chaitanya Math in a visible form into the heart of the world. Sri Chaitanya Math is eternally located as the original source even when it is manifested to the view of the people of this world, in the transcendental environment of the eternal Abode of the Divinity. The activities of the Gaudiya Math and of the other sister branch Maths are, however, essentially identical with those of Sri Chaitanya Math and are categorically different from the ordinary activities of this world.",
  h3Para32:
    "Here we discover the template upon which Śrīla Prabhupāda faithfully modeled ISKCON’s own spiritual configuration, presented together with the profound—you can say “esoteric”— meaning of it: There is a unique, preeminent “parental” temple situated in Śrīdhāma Māyāpur, “eternally located as the original source,” even as it also “is manifest to the view of the people of this world.” Note that “the original source” is not a reference simply to some relatively recent construction in rural Bengal. Rather, “the original source” of the Gauḍīya Maṭha is “eternally located” in the spiritual realm, that is, “the transcendental environment of the eternal Abode of the Divinity.” That transcendent temple, however, is also made immanent, “manifest to the view of the people of this world.”",
  h3Para33:
    "Śrīdhāma Māyāpur, the place of Lord Caitanya’s appearance and activities, is simultaneously transcendent and immanent, for, we know that whenever and wherever the Lord descends, His eternal abode and associates all descend with Him. Thus the transcendent realm of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s eternal vṛndāvana-līlā, called Goloka Vṛndāvana, becomes manifest on the earthly plane as Gokula Vṛndāvana. Similarly, the everlasting realm of Lord Caitanya’s līlā ­in Kṛṣṇaloka, known as Śvetadvīpa, appears in Bengal as the manifest Navadvīpa and its enclosed Śrīdhāma Māyāpur. At these and other such sacred places on earth, the material and spiritual worlds are made, so to speak, contiguous, facilitating crossing over. Hence, the name for such pilgrimage destinations is tīrtha, or ford.",
  h3Para34:
    "This and more, as we shall see, is disclosed, celebrated, and facilitated by the Founder-Ācārya at the “Parent Temple,” which serves at the tīrtha as a visible kind of entrance as of a portal, or gateway, or bridge.",
  h3Para35:
    "When this central temple, by the mercy of devotees, extends outward from its inherently sacred environment into profane regions, these expansions or branches, even though distant from their source, are essentially identical with it. The analogy of “one lamp lighted by another,” employed by The Harmonist, is taken from Brahma-saṁhitā (5.46), where it is used to elucidate the relationship between Lord Kṛṣṇa and His expansions, like Balarāma, Mahā-viṣṇu, and so on. The use of the metaphor here implies that all the institution’s temples, as integral components of a spiritual organization, will be equally potent, even though one is the original, and the others, its branches or branches of branches.",
  h3Para36:
    "Having established the essential unity of the original source with its branches and sub-branches, the article goes on to propound the spiritual identity that unifies the Founder-Ācārya with his organization, its various parts and branches, and each of its individual members:",
  h3Para37:
    "The Gaudiya Math is also identical with its founder Acharyya (sic). The associates, followers and abode of His Divine Grace are limbs of himself. None of them claim to be anything but a fully subordinate limb of this single individual. This unconditional, causeless, spontaneous submission to the Head, is found to be not only compatible with, but also absolutely necessary for the fullest freedom of initiative of the subordinate limbs.",
  h3Para38:
    "The wholesome spiritual organization, acting with exemplary coherence and concord, is non-different from the Founder-Ācārya. The society is that august, divine personage in another form, the incorporated expansion of his own loving service to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. This point is further elucidated:",
  h3Para39:
    "All activity of the Gaudiya Math emanates from His Divine Grace Paramahansa Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Maharaj, the spiritual successor of Sri Rupa Goswami who was originally authorised by Sri Caitanyadeva to explain the process of loving spiritual devotion for the benefit of all souls. The reality of the whole activity of the Gaudiya Math depends on the initiative of the Acharya. Sri Chaitanya Math of Sridham Mayapur reveals the source of the Gaudiya Math. The Acharya dwells eternally with the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna Chaitanya in His transcendental Abode in Sridham Mayapur, White Island of the Scriptures. From there the Acharya manifests his appearance on the mundane plane for the redemption of souls from the grip of the deluding energy and conferring on them loving devotion to the Feet of Sri Sri Radha-Govinda. The off-shoots of Sri Chaitanya Math are an extension of the centre of the bestowal of grace for the benefit of souls in all parts of the world. The recognition of the connection with Sridham Mayapur is vital for realising the true nature of the Gaudiya Math and the grace of the Acharya.",
  h3Para40:
    "This passage repays alert reading and reflection. It is a penetrating portrayal of the spiritual structure and function of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s organization. It was written in 1930, yet we can clearly recognize the organization of essential elements of a spiritual institution—the Founder-Ācārya, the central temple of the Ācārya, its disbursed extensions—that is the clear template for ISKCON, founded thirty-five years later by Śrīla Siddhānta Sarasvatī’s fully dedicated sārasvata disciple, who constructed ISKCON on the basis of a deep and faithful comprehension of his own guru’s works.",
  h3Para41:
    "Guided by that paradigm, we can recognize the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura as the prototype, in regard to place, form, and function, of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s Temple of the Vedic Planetarium at Māyāpur. The basis for Śrīla Prabhupāda’s determination to have his movement’s central temple and world headquarters here becomes clear.",
  h3Para42:
    "It was at first, to many of us, a great mystery, accepted on faith alone. Most who journeyed to Māyāpur for the first of the annual Gaura-pūrṇimā observances were astounded, upon arrival, to think that Prabhupāda wanted our “world headquarters” here, that here the Governing",

Was it really and truly here that Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted to establish the heart of ISKCON? “Why not Los Angeles?” some wondered aloud. “Or at least Bombay?” It became yet another test of our faith and of our surrender.",
  h3Para44:
    "Śrīla Prabhupāda’s conviction that ISKCON’s headquarter temple belongs here testifies to his own faith in and surrender to his spiritual master, whose spiritual vision of the Gauḍīya institution is conveyed by The Harmonist article.",
  h3Para45:
    "Moreover, since Śrīla Prabhupāda faithfully fabricated ISKCON on the paradigm of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s movement, we can also take advantage of the depiction of that movement in The Harmonist to understand the higher, extraterrestrial region of ISKCON.",
  h3Para46:
    "Today at Māyāpur in Bengal anyone can observe the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium and the memorial temple of ISKCON’s Founder-Ācārya—both of them domed structures, as it turned out—facing each other across an open plaza. We should regard this display as the terrestrial",

  h3Para48:
    "Nor can it be that the ISKCON here and the ISKCON there are disconnected. The Temple of the Vedic Planetarium itself is both the sign and assurance of that connection, between, so to speak, the bhauma and the divya ISKCON. As Founder-Ācārya, Śrīla Prabhupāda leads the ISKCON yatra there—an everlasting saṅkīrtana-yajña in gaura-līlā—but he is also able to exercise a special providential care for the ISKCON here and even, upon occasion, to depute his associates there to guide, strengthen, and inspire his followers here.",

The temple at the heart of ISKCON is fashioned— like its prototype, the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha—not only for the purpose of arcana, divine worship, but also for parā-vidyā, for education in supreme transcendental knowledge as given by Lord Caitanya.",
  h3Para51:
    "The Śrī Caitanya Maṭha presents this highest knowledge by means of the history of its revelation, its historical unfolding over time.

Kali-yuga is so bad, that were all the godless slain, there would be hardly anyone left. So Lord Caitanya’s saṅkīrtana is the appropriate process, the yuga-dharma, for our times.",

It impresses upon the visitor, in a formidable and memorable manner, the central Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava recognition, both historical and philosophical, of the comprehensiveness, inclusiveness, and supremacy of the ultimate Vedāntic synthesis, acintya-bhedābheda- tattva, promulgated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself.",
  h3Para66:
    "The understanding of Vaiṣṇava history that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura expounded in this tangible way had been received by him through his father, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, who, in the late nineteenth century, had commenced the endeavor of propagating Lord Caitanya’s movement globally. In his book Daśa-mula- tattva, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura summarized his presentation of how Lord Caitanya “purified and perfected” the teachings of the four Founder-Ācāryas:",
  h3Para67:
    "The previous philosophical expositions of the Absolute Truth based on the Veda by different ācāryas were all incomplete and at variance with each other. As a result, different paramparās, preceptorial chains of disciplic succession, were founded. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, appeared and, by His omniscient potency, synthesised and supplemented the ideas of their philosophies. Śrī Madhvācārya’s concept of the transcendental form of the Supreme Lord—the embodiment of eternality, absolute knowledge and unlimited bliss; Śrī Rāmānuja’s concept of the status of the Supreme Lord’s eternal associates and transcendental energies; Śrī Viṣṇu Svāmī’s concept of purified monism; and Śrī Nimbārka’s concept of eternal simultaneous oneness and duality—all these esoteric concepts were purified and perfected by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He gave to this world, by His unlimited mercy, the most exact and scientific delineation of the Vedic conclusion in His teachings of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva, the principle of inconceivable simultaneous oneness and difference. Within a short time, a singular spiritual line—the Śrī Brahma- sampradāya—has gained unexpected pre-eminence [because Lord Caitanya received initiation into it], and all the other sampradāyas, spiritual lines, have become subservient to and will reach perfection by its metaphysical precepts.",
  h3Para68:
    "In this way, by means of the central maṇḍala of the “Parent Temple,” the entire institution becomes knit together and expressed as an integrated whole, exemplifying as well as teaching the ultimate principle of divinity taught by Lord Caitanya, acintya- bhedābheda-tattva.",
  h3Para69: "TEMPLE OF THE VEDIC PLANETARIUM",
  h3Para70:
    "Śrīla Prabhupāda had devoted profound and prolonged attention to the words and deeds of his spiritual master, and he had taken to heart his guru’s instructions—given orally at their first meeting and in writing in their last communication—to spread Lord Caitanya’s movement in the English language. He managed singlehandedly the task of translating into English and commenting on the First Canto of Śrīmad- Bhāgavatam, printing and publishing the work in three volumes in India.",
  h3Para71:
    "Armed with these books, he sailed for the United States, alone, where in New York City he began to gain dedicated students. Seeing great potential for preaching, he appealed to Godbrothers in India for help and cooperation, but his appeals fell on deaf ears. At the same time, his own guru’s",
  h3Para72:
    "organization remained shattered and in disarray, the sundering having begun along the very fracture that the 1930 Harmonist article had sought to heal. Śrīla Prabhupāda realized that when it came to the revival and continuation of his Guru Mahārāja’s mission, he was on his own. Consequently, in July of 1966 in New York he founded The International Society for Krishna Consciousness.",
  h3Para73:
    "As ISKCON quickly blossomed into a world-spanning enterprise, Śrīla Prabhupāda remained guided by his spiritual master’s prior effort. For him, the Gauḍīya Mission served as the prototype or template for ISKCON, which itself became, in effect, the resurrection, augmentation, and perpetuation of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s organization, an organization that served for Śrīla Prabhupāda as a kind of beta-test version of his global movement. In this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda followed in the footsteps of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.",
  h3Para74:
    "It is not surprising to recognize that Śrīla Prabhupāda undertook to construct ISKCON according to the principles spelled out in The Harmonist article of 1930, which disclosed the singular import of the central or “parent” temple at Śrīdhāma Māyāpur, as well as its connection with the Founder-Ācārya. And, as we have seen, that unique temple embodies the most confidential teaching disclosed by Māyāpura- candrodaya—Lord Caitanya—Himself: acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.",
  h3Para75:
    "Śrīla Prabhupāda chose not to imitate or duplicate the way Śrī Caitanya Maṭha presented the supremacy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva; rather he chose to augment and expand on that exposition. Just as his world-wide movement itself is an expansion and augmentation of Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s, so, appropriately, will be its headquarter temple.",
  h3Para76:
    "The Deities on the three main altars of the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, for example, are expansions and elaborations of the Deities at the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha. The Śrī Caitanya Maṭha enshrines Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa; the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa",
  h3Para77:
    "accompanied by the eight intimate associates of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the aṣṭa-sakhī-gopīs. The Śrī Caitanya Maṭha worships Lord Gaurāṅga; the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, the entire Pañca-tattva. The Śrī Caitanya Maṭha hallows the four historical Founder-Ācāryas; the altar in the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium hallows the entire lineage of great Ācāryas in our Brahma-sampradāya.",
  h3Para78:
    "The Temple of the Vedic Planetarium also embodies acintya-bhedābheda-tattva as the ultimate principle of Vedānta, not through the history of teachings, but rather by means of a dynamic representation of the entire inventory of existence, of all that there is: to put it succinctly,",
  h3Para79:
    "Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s energies. This representation hangs, suspended over the main temple room from the apex of the dome “a huge, detailed model of the universe as described in the text of the fifth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam,” as Śrīla Prabhupāda described it in a letter of 1976. He went on to list fifteen numbered features, beginning with Pātāla-loka and the bila-svarga underworld at the base, and ending with Goloka Vṛndāvana at the top. “This model,” Śrīla Prabhupāda further specified, “will be engineered to suspend from the structure of the dome and rotate according to the real movement of the planets.”",
  h3Para80:
    "The model—about 140 feet in length and 65 feet in diameter—will, of course, be visible from the main temple-room floor, and visitors will get much closer, detailed views from three levels of open gallery, accessible by escalators, around the inside of the dome. These galleries will also offer",
  h3Para81:
    "additional details and explanations, and the entire cosmology will be further explored and explained in the west, museum wing, of the temple.",
  h3Para82: "KṚṢṆA’S UNIVERSAL FORM: THE COSMOS AS BODY OF GOD",
  h3Para83:
    "The source of the cosmology in the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium is, as Śrīla Prabhupāda directed, mainly the exposition in The Fifth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. That begins (5.16.3) with this question by Mahārāja Parīkṣit:",
  h3Para84:
    " When the mind is fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His external feature made of the material modes of nature—the gross universal form—it is brought to the platform of pure goodness. In that transcendental position, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, who in His subtler form is self-effulgent and beyond the modes of nature. O my lord, please describe vividly how that form, which covers the entire universe, is perceived. SB 5.16.3",
  h3Para85:
    "Readers or hearers of the Bhāgavatam have been prepared for this Fifth Canto presentation from early on in the work. In the Second and Third Cantos we encounter five separate descriptions of the universal form—the virāṭ-rūpa—of the Lord (in the first, sixth, and tenth chapters of the Second Canto and the sixth and twenty-sixth of the Third). The initial presentation in Canto Two, Chapter One is titled, significantly, “The First Step in God Realization.”",
  h3Para86:
    "Now in the Fifth Canto the Bhāgavatam returns to and enlarges on this topic of the virāṭ-rūpa; it presents the reader with a directed contemplation of the material world, one that purifies and elevates the consciousness, “brings the mind to the platform of pure goodness.” The conventional way of looking at this world has the opposite effect; it besmirches and degrades the mind. Our customary way of seeing, probing, and appraising the world is undertaken with the aim of enjoying, controlling, and exploiting it and its contents. By so doing we explicitly or implicitly separate the creation from its creator, mentally alienating the world from its true owner and controller. Consequently, the divinity that pervades and hallows the world remains beyond our ken.",
  h3Para87:
    "Our materially infected consciousness, corrupted by desire, cannot perceive even this world as it really is, to say nothing of the Lord in His transcendent form. Even so, we do recognize objects that correspond to words like “tree,” “cloud,” “mountain,” “river,” “bird,” and the like, and the",
  h3Para88:
    "Bhāgavatam directs us (in the first chapter of the Second Canto) to see trees as the hair on the Lord’s body, rivers as His veins, mountains as His bones, birdsongs as exhibitions of His artistic taste, and so on.",
  h3Para89:
    "Perceiving these natural phenomena as belonging to the Lord’s form begins to cleanse our perception. As consciousness becomes clarified, the presence of divinity in the world becomes self-evident. This perception, articulated as a theology, is called pantheism; from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s perspective, it is a part—an initial glimpse—of the truth of divinity. With this we see one of the reasons for prominently featuring the virāṭ-rūpa at the heart of Lord Caitanya’s global movement: offering that “first step” in God realization to all comers.",
  h3Para90: "THE RESPIRITUALIZATION OF MATTER",
  h3Para91:
    "The other purpose is to put on display a vivid and comprehensive presentation of Lord Caitanya’s Vedāntic synthesis, acintya-bhedābheda-tattva. This principle (tattva) expresses the relationship between Lord Kṛṣṇa and His various energies. It stipulates that you can neither conceive of the creation as identical with Kṛṣṇa, nor can you conceive of it as different from Him. Śrīla Prabhupāda formulates the principle quite succinctly in his purport to the final verse of Bhagavad-gītā: “Nothing is different from the Supreme, but the Supreme is always different from everything.” He gives another aphoristic formulation in his purport to Caitanya-caritāmṛta Ādi 1.51: “In a sense, there is nothing but Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and yet nothing is Śrī Kṛṣṇa save and except His primeval personality.” “The universal form is certainly material,” Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote, commenting on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.16.3, “but because everything is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ultimately nothing is material.” He elaborates on this idea in the short book The Path of Perfection:",
  h3Para92:
    "In a higher sense, there is no matter at all. Everything is spiritual. Because Kṛṣṇa is spiritual and matter is one of the energies of Kṛṣṇa, matter is also spiritual. Kṛṣṇa is totally spiritual, and spirit comes from spirit. However, because the living entities are misusing this energy—that is, using it for something other than Kṛṣṇa’s purposes—it becomes materialized, and so we call it matter. The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to respiritualize this energy. It is our purpose to respiritualize the whole world, socially and politically. Of course, this may not be possible, but it is our ideal. At least if we individually take up this respiritualization process, our lives become perfect.",
  h3Para93:
    "“Respiritualization” is also described in the purport to Bhagavad-gītā 4.24:",
  h3Para94:
    "The more the activities of the material world are performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or for Viṣṇu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption ….. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahma-jyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahma-jyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (māyā) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by Kṛṣṇa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are—all combined together—Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by māyā is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme.",
  h3Para95:
    "Those who are highly advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness perceive this world in relationship to Kṛṣṇa, as pervaded and controlled by the Lord (īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam), and the cosmology as described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and as depicted in the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, is the record of their direct experience. Today we also have been given the means by Lord Caitanya to verify that experience by our own. For this reason, Śrīla Prabhupāda has called Kṛṣṇa consciousness “a science.” The science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is certainly not the same as the relatively recently developed material science, and the cosmos modeled in the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium differs greatly from that as perceived by our limited material senses, whether working unaidedly or augmented and extended by instruments of modern technology. The Temple of the Vedic Planetarium is a challenge to the limitations, defects, and errors of our man-made ways of knowing.",
  h3Para96:
    "Space travel, for example, is described regularly in the pages of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. We find frequent accounts interplanetary travel, most notably the star trekking voyages of the sage Nārada Muni, a great yogi and Vedic cosmonaut; Śrīla Prabhupāda referred to him as “the eternal spaceman.”",
  h3Para97:
    "In fact, the Bhāgavatam presents systematically descriptions of all the greater and lesser yoga-siddhis—science-fiction-like powers such as teleportation, miniaturization, remote viewing, and so on—which in the Bhāgavatam are recognized not as miracles or magic, but rather as jñāna and vijñāna, knowledge and science. But, as the scientist and science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke observed: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”",
  h3Para98:
    "Lord Caitanya has ushered into the modern world the highly elevated and sophisticated technology of an earlier time, giving us in this kali-yuga some access to its advanced conclusions and their practical applications. The Temple of the Vedic Planetarium presents many of them, and the area of ancient Vedic cosmology and astronomy is a large and fascinating field of study. To encourage and facilitate such research, there will be, as an adjunct to the Temple, an Institute for the Study of Vedic Cosmology and Astronomy. This will be part of a broader project to fulfill Śrīla Prabhupāda’s desire to make Māyāpur to be a center for the academic study of Vaiṣṇavism. In 1976 he gave clear directions for what he called “ISKCON Bhāgavata College” in Māyāpur. He wanted this to be a graduate level, degree-granting institute, affiliated with an established “secular” university. Our institute would house a extensive research library centered on our own Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava literature as well as the works of the four historical Vaiṣṇava sampradāyas.",
  h3Para99: "RESEARCH ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES OF SPIRITUAL SCIENCE",
  h3Para100:
    "Our research into Vedic cosmology and astronomy will take advantage of modern scholarship, but it will also facilitate researchers who work according to the recognized Vaiṣṇava principles of knowledge, which prominently included four regulative principles: to abstain from meat eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. People commonly categorize such injunctions as “principles of morality” having to do with reward and punishment, with good or bad karma. The Vaiṣṇava traditions, however, regard them also a cognitive principles. These principles make possible a culture of sattva-guna, the mode of goodness, and Bhagavad-gītā (14.17) states sattvāt sañjāyate jñānaṁ, “from the mode of goodness real knowledge develops.” Thus, the mode of goodness is the basis of the brahminical or intellectual class, which is supposed to guide and direct human society.",
  h3Para101:
    "Of course, modern intellectuals recognize no such regulative principles of knowledge. As Śrīla Prabhupāda notes, in the purport to Bhagavad-gītā 14.7, “Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition",
  h3Para102:
    "was considered to be in the mode of goodness.” For those scientists and intellectuals advanced by modern standards, the realm of transcendence or divinity is opaque, a matter at best of faith, not knowledge. They have no cognitive access to it, and probably little, if any, interest.",
  h3Para103:
    "The Bhāgavatam cosmology is the product of knowledge and experience based on sattva, on purity in thinking, feeling, and willing. When the condition of sattva undergoes further purification and intensification, it is called viśuddha-sattva—pure goodness. In that state, it becomes possible to attain pareśānubhavaḥ, direct perception of the Supreme Lord. And thereupon all else becomes known: “When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown. The Vedas (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.1.3) say, kasminn u bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavatīti” (Bhagavad-gītā 7.2, purport).",
  h3Para104:
    "Such is the process of knowledge by which the cosmos becomes known and understood. To be sure, there is some congruence between the cosmos as understood through modern technology and that as presented in the Bhāgavatam. But the latter discloses the creation in",
  h3Para105:
    "relation to the creator, the cosmos as pervaded and animated by the Lord—īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam, as the first verse of the Īśopaniṣad puts it. And the cosmos, as perceive in that way, is itself pūrṇa, full, perfect and complete. “All forms of incompleteness,” Śrīla Prabhupāda comments, “are experienced due to incomplete knowledge of the Complete Whole.”",
  h3Para106:
    "When you look at the model of that cosmos suspended beneath Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa under the dome of the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, you may not recognize the cosmos as you think you know it. For that model is derived from that ultimate vision of everything as spiritual. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 4.29.69, the yogic cosmonaut Nārada Muni himself discloses how one may attain that vision. He says,",
  h3Para107:
    "“Kṛṣṇa consciousness means constantly associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in such a mental state that the devotee can observe the cosmic manifestation exactly as the Supreme Personality of Godhead does.”",
  h3Para108:
    "Keeping one’s mind very close to Lord Kṛṣṇa, one may be able to see the phenomenal world in just the way that He does. When, by our cooperative efforts worldwide, the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium is completed at the heart of ISKCON, all of its associated centers everywhere will become more fully manifest as entranceways to the spiritual world. This will be a major achievement—a crowning achievement—of Śrīla Prabhupāda’s project, following Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, of “the respiritualization of the entire human society,” empowering the whole world to “convert the illusory consciousness into Brahman.”",
